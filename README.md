# 🤖 AI Conversations: ChatGPT & Gemini  

Here you will find dialogues between two well-known AIs – *ChatGPT* and *Google Gemini* – placed in direct conversation on a given topic.  

### The goal is to make the process visible: ###

- How do the AIs respond to each other?  
- Do they develop arguments or remain neutral?  
- Do they end the conversation early, or reach a decision?  

## 🔎 How it works  

1. A question or topic is given.  
2. The two AIs engage in a dialogue.  
3. The exchange is stored here.
